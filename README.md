# Structured Load Manager

Cross platform application to convert Structured Load data into various formats. Still in development, though code is here to serve as an example. 

![Structured Load Demo](https://s1.gifyu.com/images/output081ef4d151dc38e7.gif)

Utilises Electron, React, Redux and many other excellent Javascript libraries.

# To Do
- More tests
- Structured Load output to various Review platforms (Introspect, Reccomind, Relativity)


## Run

Start the app in the `dev` environment. This starts the renderer process in [**hot-module-replacement**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hmr-react/) mode and starts a server that sends hot updates to the renderer process:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Boilerplate code based heavily on the excellent work over at https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate.
